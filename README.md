# lazy-rest
The is a wreckless and contraversial REST library I wrote that caters to the laziest of developers that will go to all costs to not write the same code over and over albeit just changing the URL string a tad, who are also sicking of writing the exact same response success and error callbacks for every REST call that takes place.
